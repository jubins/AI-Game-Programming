## Heuristics
The Heuristics folder contains has games developed using basic game programming algorithms developed in Lua, game design and game engines.

## Reinforcement Learning
The Reinforcement Learning folder contains the games developed using Open AI Gym and Universe, and also Deep Q RL algorithms.
